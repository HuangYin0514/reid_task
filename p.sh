The standard frameworks for Hamiltonian and Lagrangian dynamics are typically presented as sets of first- and second-order ordinary differential equations (ODE), respectively. In 2018, Chen et al. proposed the neural ordinary differential exquation (Node) method 29, a continuous deep neural network-based approach that utilizes neural networks to represent the time-continuous dynamics of hidden states.
The Node method models the time evolution of a hidden unit as a constant neural differential equation, as shown in Equation (1):

where t represents time, x(t) is a continuous representation of the hidden state, and θ refers to the network weights and biases. The evolution function f(x(t),t,θ), parameterized by the neural network, describes the dynamics of the hidden state over time. By solving the initial value problem (IVP) using the initial conditions x(t0), the hidden state x(t1) at the next moment is obtained. Therefore, the time evolution of the state x(t) can be represented as a time integral, as shown in Equation (2):

where ODESolve is an ODE numerical solver. To improve memory utilization efficiency, the concomitant sensitivity method is used during backpropagation 29. Furthermore, the Node method allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge of physical principles into the network, enabling the parameterization of unknown physical quantities in the dynamics, such as mass, potential energy, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian quantities.
