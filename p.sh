This section introduces our proposed MDANN method. The method comprises two key modules: the Lagrangian mechanics module and the multiscale module. The Lagrangian mechanics module facilitates the learning of Lagrangian quantities by employing a system of DAE with explicit constraints. On the other hand, the multiscale module utilizes radial scaling to transform high-frequency components into low-frequency components, thereby enabling the learning of physical processes at various frequencies within Lagrangian quantities.
3.1  |Lagrangian Mechanics Module
The utilization of Lagrangian quantities to ensure energy conservation in a system has proven invaluable for comprehensively understanding the underlying physical processes 7. By explicitly incorporating constraints, the learning of Lagrangian quantities is further enhanced, leading to improved data efficiency and prediction accuracy.
In this module, we employ the Lagrange multiplier method, which utilizes a system of DAE to explicitly handle constraints and obtain the Lagrangian quantities of the system. The module consists of two key components: a differential component and an algebraic component. The differential component focuses on the ODE of motion, which describe the temporal evolution of an object or system. It allows for the conservation of the Lagrangian quantity of the system. By considering variables such as position, velocity, and acceleration, we can infer the dynamic behavior over time. Differential equations provide the fundamental framework for describing the motion of an object or system. On the other hand, the algebraic component involves the algebraic constraint equations that capture the relationships within the system, including binding forces and other constraints. These equations effectively represent the interactions and constraints among the different components. Figure 11 depicts a schematic diagram of the Lagrangian mechanics module.
